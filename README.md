# SAVE COWS

A simple browser game created for a DIO's gameDev bootcamp challenge.

## Description

The game consists of rescuing cows and eliminating the enemies that appear along the way (no spoilers). All animations and mechanics were based solely on the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript resources (JQuery included).

## Execution

As a browser game, all you need to do is download the files and type the full path to the HTML file into the browser's address bar.
